# SeniorDesign

This project was a Senior Design project for students Rachel Cutlan, Kate Piper, Shahd Sawahli, Ellie Lammers, and Sarah Ernst at Marquette University in 2021-2022. The goal of the project was to create an iOS application to conduct gross motor and balance tests on children from ages 3-6 years old. The focus of the project was on creating the technology, and further research needs to be conducted in order to apply the application to research.

The application opens on a welcome page. The user can move to an instruction page or continue in the application. 

The parent instruction page tells the parents a little about the testing. This page will be changed as the usage of the app changes.

After the welcome page or the parent instruction page, the user moves to a tape diagram page. This page shows the user how to set up the tape line for the test.

Following tape placement, the user continues to the check camera page. This page asks the user to make sure that the child is visible in the camera. This is where the application asks for permission to access the camera.

When the camera opens, a pop up comes up. This includes further parent instructions for the set up.

Once the camera has been checked, the parent can proceed to the avatar page. On this page, there is a video of an Avatar made in Blender which performs the gross motor development movements. The movements that are performed are standing on one leg, standing on toes, and jumping. These files can be found through communication with Dr. Nemanich. The avatar page also includes an additional pop up to inform the parent of more instructions. After swiping the pop up, the parent can begin the test for their child. Upon starting the test, the back and finish buttons become small so that they are unable to be clicked. Once finish test is clicked, the user will again be prompted for permission to access the photos app. When the user hits finish, this video is stored in photos.

The final page is the congratulations page. This thanks the user for completing the test and leads them to a link for a Box sign in. This is where they will upload their video. This may be changed in future iterations of the project.
